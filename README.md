# Case Study: Divvy

This is an example R case study I created based open source data provided by Lyft Bikes and Scooters LLC who operate the city of Chicagoâ€™s Divvy bike sharing service, which allows people to hire bicycles from any of 600+ bike stations across Chicago for short-duration trips.

Further information on the Divvy bike service data can be found at https://ride.divvybikes.com/system-data.
The data itself is available at https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html and has been provided for use under the following agreement https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement.

There are two versions of the case study: a .Rmd RMarkdown version and a Jupyter Notebook version (plus HTML and PDF renderings of both). They are otherwise identical.
